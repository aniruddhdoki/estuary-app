## what's cool about this: 
i extract the main colors of the shoe to create a custom linear gradient for the background of the shoe's detail view, allowing you to be fully immersed in the artisanship of each sneaker.

## future implementations: 
- get search functionality to work
  - users can look up any shoe and appreciate its beauty
